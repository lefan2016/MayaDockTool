# Maya Window Dock Example

    This example project is to create Maya tool. By binding *.ui file.

## Why

    Binding *.ui file for the tool is way more faster. So by usin this method,
    I believe
    
    This method wasn't the right or wrong. But till now, this method is suit for me so damn well.

    There's no fully correct or bad method for programming/scripting.
    Which one is suit you well will cut timeline for development.

### About

    This feature added for Autodesk Maya 2017++

    By default. Most of your module for tool is placed on script folder
    or from maya version script version.

    Default Script Maya Folder:
        Windows10   :   username\Documents\maya\scripts

        MAC         :   $HOME/Library/Preferences/Autodesk/maya/scripts

        Linux       :   $HOME/maya/scripts

    So if you want add more control tools for different version, you can go to:
        Windows10   :   username\Documents\maya\mayaVERSION\scripts

    You can place "myMayaTool" folder to that location

See "polygonTool" for more detail.
